This repository showcases an interesting project I've developed using the Langchain framework. The centerpiece of this project is an innovative application that when given a person's name and some details unique to them, it tries to identify the exact person you are trying to refer to, by searching through LinkedIn and Twitter for their data, tweets, etc. and provides a rich array of information about them. It not only furnishes interesting facts but also offers an engaging icebreaker to initiate conversations with them. The aim is to make introductions more intriguing and enjoyable.
